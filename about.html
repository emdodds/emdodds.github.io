I work in the
    <a href='http://redwood.berkeley.edu/' target='_blank'>
            Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience</a> at UC Berkeley with <a href=http://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/Michael-DeWeese' target='_blank'>
        Mike DeWeese</a>. My research focuses on machine learning, the statistics of natural sounds and scenes, and models of sensory processing.

There's a lot more about what I do and have done on the <a href='projects.html'>Projects page</a>.

I'm a PhD candidate in the physics department because I spent the first three years of graduate school on theoretical particle physics before finding a better fit in my current group. Before that I got my B.A. <i>magna cum laude</i> in physics and math at <a href='https://www.pomona.edu/'>Pomona College</a> in Claremont, CA in 2012. My physics thesis explored my trials and tribulations in Dwight Whitaker's BEC lab, my math thesis with Vin de Silva explained conservation laws using symplectic geometry, and I spent a summer at CERN making handy histograms for the CMS RPC group and other acronyms.

Born in St. Louis, MO, I grew up in a quiet suburb called Des Peres and graduated from Parkway South High in 2008.

I spend my free time with my guitar, plastic flying discs, and my wife. I also used to play my violin more, and on occasion I write novels.
