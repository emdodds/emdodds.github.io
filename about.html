<p>
I work at Yahoo as a Research Scientist, focused on bringing and developing the latest machine learning advances to applications for the benefit of the company's users and adverstisers.
Sometimes I get to share our work with the wider research community, and you can find more about
what I do and have done on the <a href='projects.html'>Projects page</a>.

I completed my PhD work in the
    <a href='http://redwood.berkeley.edu/' target='_blank'>
            Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience</a> at UC Berkeley with <a href=http://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/Michael-DeWeese' target='_blank'>
        Mike DeWeese</a>. My dissertation research focused on machine learning, the statistics of natural sounds and scenes, and models of sensory processing.

I spent the first three years of graduate school at UC Berkeley on theoretical particle physics before finding a better fit in theoretical/computational neuroscience. Before that I got my B.A. <i>magna cum laude</i> in physics and math at <a href='https://www.pomona.edu/'>Pomona College</a> in Claremont, CA in 2012. My physics thesis explored my trials and tribulations in Dwight Whitaker's BEC lab, my math thesis with Vin de Silva explained conservation laws using symplectic geometry, and I spent a summer at CERN making handy histograms for the CMS RPC group and other acronyms.

Born in St. Louis, MO, I grew up in a quiet suburb called Des Peres and graduated from Parkway South High in 2008.

I now live in Berkeley, CA with my wife and cats. In my free time I enjoy singing and other musical activities as well as ultimate (frisbee) and the occasional game on a board or computer screen.
