### Machine learning
I'm interested broadly in using statistical models to understand and benefit from large data sets. I'm spending summer 2018 at Yahoo Research working on deep learning research and applications. My PhD work in theoretical neuroscience also uses machine learning ideas and techniques, and I like to dabble in deep learning and other practical data science techniques through side projects.

### Normative models of neural sensory systems
In my neuroscience work, I try to understand sensory systems (particularly vision and audition) starting with a notion of optimality -- how *should* the system work based on what we think it's trying to do? Supposing that it is beneficial to form efficient or sparse representations of sensory signals an animal encounters, for example, we expect the brain to be adapted for this purpose. We can then develop a statistic model of these signals with some of the structure and constraints of a biological neural system, and compare the parameters or behavior of this model to properties of a real brain.

### Natural ensemble statistics
The statistical models I described above have to be suited to the sensory signals that animals encounter if we hope to learn anything about the brain. This has led me to study the statistical structure of natural sounds and images as their own objects of interest.
